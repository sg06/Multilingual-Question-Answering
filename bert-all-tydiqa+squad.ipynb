   <td>Balansiyya had a rebirth of sorts with the beginning of the Taifa of Valencia kingdom in the 11th century. The town grew, and during the reign of Abd al-Aziz a new city wall was built, remains of which are preserved throughout the Old City (Ciutat Vella) today. The Castilian nobleman Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, known as El Cid, who was intent on possessing his own principality on the Mediterranean, entered the province in command of a combined Christian and Moorish army and besieged the city beginning in 1092. By the time the siege ended in May 1094, he had carved out his own fiefdom—which he ruled from 15 June 1094 to July 1099. This victory was immortalised in the Lay of the Cid. During his rule, he converted nine mosques into churches and installed the French monk Jérôme as bishop of the See of Valencia. El Cid was killed in July 1099 while defending the city from an Almoravid siege, whereupon his wife Ximena Díaz ruled in his place for two years.</td>\n","      <td>Who was the ruler when the new city wall was constructed?</td>\n","      <td>{'text': ['Abd al-Aziz'], 'answer_start': [146]}</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>arabic--3198255694329407591-0</td>\n","      <td>أمل كلوني</td>\n","      <td>أمل علم الدين (اسم الولادة أمل علم الدين، مولودة في 3 فبراير 1978) هي محامية وناشطة حقوقية وكاتبة إنجليزية من أصل لبناني. تعمل محاميةً في مكتب دوتي ستريت تشامبرز، متخصصة في القانون الدولي وحقوق الإنسان.[1].</td>\n","      <td>متى ولدت أمل علم الدين المحامية الناشطة الحقوقية والكاتبة الإنجليزية ؟</td>\n","      <td>{'text': ['3 فبراير 1978'], 'answer_start': [53]}</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>korean--4765368616512639259-0</td>\n","      <td>플레이스테이션 4</td>\n","      <td>플레이스테이션 4(, , PS4)는 2013년에 출시된 가정용 게임기이다. 줄여서 PS4라고도 한다. 2013년 2월 20일(동부 표준시)에 뉴욕에서 이루어진 이벤트 '플레이스테이션 미팅 2013'(PlayStation Meeting 2013)에서 소니가 발표하였고[1] 11월 15일, 북미에서 처음 출시되어 출시 24시간만에 100만대 이상 판매하는 기록을 세웠다.[2] 2014년 3월 2일 누적 판매량 600만대 이상을 넘었다.</td>\n","      <td>플레이스테이션 4 개발사는 어디인가요?</td>\n","      <td>{'text': ['소니'], 'answer_start': [139]}</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>arabic-8033925895297205775-0</td>\n","      <td>ويليام هيرشل</td>\n","      <td>فريدريك ويليام هيرشل (15 نوفمبر 1738 – 25 أغسطس 1822) عالم فلك وملحن بريطاني من أصل ألماني. اتبع هيرشل خطوات أبيه فانضم للفرقة الموسيقية العسكرية التابعة لهانوفر، قبل هجرته إلى بريطانيا العظمى عن عمر يُناهز التاسع عشر، وهو شقيق العالِمة كارولين هيرشل. أصبح مشهوراً لاكتشافه كوكب أورانوس، وقمريه الرئيسيين تيتانيا، وأوبيرون، بالإضافة إلى قمري زحل. وقد كان أيضا أول من اكتشف وجود الأشعة تحت الحمراء. وألف وإشتُهر بسمفونياته الأربعة والعشرين، وعدداً من القطع الموسيقية التي لحنها.</td>\n","      <td>من هو ويليام هيرشل؟</td>\n","      <td>{'text': ['عالم فلك وملحن بريطاني من أصل ألماني'], 'answer_start': [55]}</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>572672e8708984140094c679</td>\n","      <td>Dutch_language</td>\n","      <td>Both languages are still largely mutually intelligible, although this relation can in some fields (such as lexicon, spelling and grammar) be asymmetric, as it is easier for Dutch speakers to understand written Afrikaans than it is for Afrikaans speakers to understand written Dutch.
