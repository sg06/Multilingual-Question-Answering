The Nichols Arboretum, owned by the University of Michigan, is a 123-acre (50 ha) arboretum that contains hundreds of plant and tree species. It is on the city's east side, near the university's Central Campus. Located across the Huron River just beyond the university's North Campus is the university's Matthaei Botanical Gardens, which contains 300 acres of gardens and a large tropical conservatory.</td>\n","      <td>How big is the Matthaei botanical garden?</td>\n","      <td>{'text': ['300 acres'], 'answer_start': [967]}</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"}],"source":["show_random_elements(datasets[\"train\"])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":16,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-08T15:54:23.957058Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-08T15:54:23.956190Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-08T15:54:29.884861Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-08T15:54:29.884064Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-08T15:54:23.957017Z"},"id":"orrH7WULUvWL","outputId":"2f0eab99-5d19-40f4-ad30-51400479a9ba","trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"95e35b7f1e1044afbc6b7f3aa0059567","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Downloading:   0%|          | 0.00/29.0 [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"0133fc38a83a40149fbf46dbb808c211","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Downloading:   0%|          | 0.00/625 [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"e56fc0b2be414b60bc8d9dc7602454b2","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Downloading:   0%|          | 0.00/972k [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"93911b287bda4ed9b9cfcd5657ad8fef","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Downloading:   0%|          | 0.00/1.87M [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"}],"source":["from transformers import AutoTokenizer\n","\n","tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_checkpoint)\n","assert isinstance(tokenizer, transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerFast)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":17,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-08T15:54:29.887619Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-08T15:54:29.887363Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-08T15:54:29.891840Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-08T15:54:29.891124Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-08T15:54:29.887584Z"},"id":"eMIAwXwvUvWM","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["max_length = 384  #
