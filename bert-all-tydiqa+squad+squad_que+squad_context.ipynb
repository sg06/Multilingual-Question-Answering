The Group A offenses are 46 specific crimes grouped in 22 offense categories. Specific facts about these offenses are gathered and reported in the NIBRS system. In addition to the Group A offenses, eleven Group B offenses are reported with only the arrest information. The NIBRS system is in greater detail than the summary-based UCR system. As of 2004, 5,271 law enforcement agencies submitted NIBRS data. That amount represents 20% of the United States population and 16% of the crime statistics data collected by the FBI.</td>\n","      <td>NIBRS సిస్టమ్ లేదా UCR సిస్టమ్ మరింత వివరణాత్మక డేటాను కలిగి ఉందా?</td>\n","      <td>{'text': ['NIBRS'], 'answer_start': [687]}</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>57100108a58dae1900cd67bf-25051</td>\n","      <td>Sexual_orientation</td>\n","      <td>Androphilia and gynephilia (or gynecophilia) are terms used in behavioral science to describe sexual attraction, as an alternative to a homosexual and heterosexual conceptualization.

This method is less efficient than blue LEDs with YAG:Ce phosphor, as the Stokes shift is larger, so more energy is converted to heat, but yields light with better spectral characteristics, which render color better. Due to the higher radiative output of the ultraviolet LEDs than of the blue ones, both methods offer comparable brightness.
